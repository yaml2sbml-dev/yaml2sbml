Examples
===============================================

We provide the following jupyter notebooks with examples:

* Three notebooks use the Lotka Volterra Equations as running example for the python tool, CLI and the Model Editor.
* A notebook demonstrating format features with minimal examples.
* A notebook showing the Sorensen model as real world application.
* A notebook implementing the Finite State Projection

These examples can also be found on Github `here <https://github.com/yaml2sbml-dev/yaml2sbml_examples>`_.
