	abstract = {Summary In this technical report we describe a simple extension to python-libSBML that allows users of Python to more easily construct SBML based models. The most commonly used package for constructing SBML models in Python is python-libSBML based on the C/C++ library libSBML. python-libSBML supports a comprehensive set of model types, but is difficult for new users to learn and requires long scripts to create even the simplest models. We present SimpleSBML, a package that allows users to add species, parameters, reactions, events, and rules to a libSBML model with only one command for each. Models can be exported to SBML format, and SBML files can be imported and converted to SimpleSBML commands that creates each element in a new model. This allows users to create new models and edit existing models for use with other software.Accessibility and Implementation SimpleSBML is publicly available and licensed under the liberal Apache 2.0 open source license. It supports SBML levels 2 and 3. Its only dependency is libSBML. It is supported on Windows and Mac OS X. All code has been deposited at the GitHub site https://github.com/sys-bio/simplesbmlContact carolc24{at}u.washington.edu or hsauro{at}u.washington.edu},

@article{KermackMcK1927,
	Abstract = {(1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.},
